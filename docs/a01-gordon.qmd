$$P = \frac{Payout}{r-g}$$

k = payout rate = Payout/Earnings

ROE = Earnings / Equity

Market-to-Book = P / Equity

$$P = \frac{k \times Earnings}{r-g}$$

$$P = \frac{k \times ROE \times Equity}{r-g}$$

$$Market-to-Book = \frac{k \times ROE}{r-g}$$

$$ \Delta Equity = Earnings - Payout = (1-k)Earnings = (1-k) \times ROE \times LagEquity $$

$$ g = (1-k) \times ROE$$




$$ \Delta Equity = (1-k) \times ROE \times (1+g) \times LagEquity$$
$$g = (1-k)\times ROE \times (1+g)$$

$$[1-(1-k)\times ROE] g = (1-k)\times ROE$$

$$g = \frac{(1-k)ROE}{1-(1-k)ROE}
$$y - x = ay$$
$$x = (1-a)y$$
$$(y-x)/x = a / (1-a)$$

$$a = (1-k)ROE$$
$$1-a =

## Factors

- Quantitative investing means investing based on quantifiable characteristics
- Stock characteristics that predict returns are sometimes called factors.  Examples:
  - value (cheap relative to book, earnings, ...)
  - momentum (high past return)
  - liquidity (high volume, low bid-ask spread, ...)
  - volatility
  - quality (profitability, high cash flow to income, ...)
  

## Sorts on characteristics <a href=http://bbcx-investments.com/risk/geometric"><img src="images/Rice_Owl.jpg"  style="width:.65in;" align="right"></a>

- Sort into quintiles or deciles
- Equally weighted or value weighted return of each group
- Re-sort at the beginning of the next period
- French's data library: monthly sorts and returns


## Investing in multiple factors

- How best to combine factors?
- Could sort on factors separately and intersect sorts 
  - Example: quintiles and 2 factors $\Rightarrow$ 25 groups
  - Quintiles and 5 factors $\Rightarrow$ 3,125 groups.  Many will be empty.
- Could form portfolio for each factor and equally weight 
- Could combine factors to predict returns and then sort on predictions

## Market efficiency

- The Efficient Markets Hypothesis is that it is not possible to earn extra returns without taking on extra risks.
- Factor investing can be profitable even if markets are efficient.  
  - The returns to factors may be risk premia.
  - Some investors may not be as averse to some risks as others are, so they should pick up the risk premia.
