# Gordon Growth Model {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

## Growing perpetuity

- Cash flows $C_1 = c$, $C_2 = (1+g)c$, $C_3 = (1+g)^2c$ and so on forever.
- Discount rate $r>g$
- PV is

. . .

$$ c\left[\frac{1}{1+r} + \frac{1+g}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{(1+g)^2}{(1+r)^3} + \cdots\right] = \frac{c}{r-g}$$

## Gordon model

- We want to value cash flows to shareholders
- $r=$ required return on equity
- Payouts to shareholders = dividends + repurchases - net issues
- Assume earnings, payouts, and book equity all grow at rate $g<r$.
- Define ROE to be earnings divided by lagged (beginning of year) equity.
- Set $k =$ payout ratio $=$ payouts / earnings.


##

- Equity grows by earnings minus payouts = $(1-k) \times$ earnings.
- Earnings $=$ ROE $\times$ lagged equity.
- $g=$ % change in equity $=$ growth in equity / lagged equity

. . .

$$=\frac{(1-k) \times \text{ROE} \times \text{lagged equity}}{\text{lagged equity}}$$

. . .

$$= (1-k) \times \text{ROE}$$

##

- Value of stock is next year's payout / $(r-g)$.
- Next year's payout is $k$ $\times$ next year's earnings.
- Next year's earnings $=$ ROE $\times$ current book equity.
- Price-to-book ratio $=$ market value of stock / book value of equity 

. . .

$$=\frac{k \times \text{ROE}}{r-(1-k)\times \text{ROE}}$$


# Dupont Analysis {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

## 

$$\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Sales}} \times \frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Lagged Assets}} $$
$$\times \frac{\text{Lagged Assets}}{\text{Lagged Equity}}$$

. . .

<br>

$$= \text{Profit Margin} \times \text{Asset Turnover}$$
$$ \times \text{Leverage}$$

# Security Analysis {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

##  Sell side and buy side

- Sell-side analysts work for brokerage firms and provide research to brokerage clients.  
  - They are a cost center and research is provided free to generate business (= commissions or advising fees).
- Buy-side analysts work for investment funds who use the research to pick stocks.

## Technical versus fundamental

- Fundamental analysts forecast important ratios and growth rates to produce earnings forecasts and price targets as in Gordon/Dupont.
- Technical analysts use past prices to generate recommendations.
  - Example: support and resistance levels.  Previous minimum (support) and maximum (resistance) stock prices are regarded as difficult to breach.  But if breached, the trend is expected to continue.
  - Example: moving averages.

# Quantitative Investing {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

##

- Quantitative investing means using quantifiable signals to pick stocks and/or to time the market.
- Signals can include the ratios and growth rates used in fundamental analysis and the signals used by technical analysts.
- Signals can also include 
  - satellite and drone image data, 
  - sentiment analysis of social media, traditional media, and company announcements, 
  - ...
