## 

## Relative performance

- If we're trying to pick the best stocks, we need to predict relative performance.
- Use return in excess of the market return as the target variable.
- Should transform to minimize outliers.
- Transform separately at each date
## Data

- We'll use monthly data 2000-2021.
- Monthly returns
- 100+ stock characteristics known at the beginning of each month from
  - past prices
  - company financials
  - earnings forecasts and announcements
- Create a model to predict returns from characteristics


## Portfolios and returns

- Mimic trading monthly
  - Form portfolio at beginning of month
  - Observe returns 
  - Form new portfolio based on updated characteristics, ...
- Data is on a SQL server at CloudClusters.net
- [Variable definitions](ghz.pdf)

## Costs of trading

- Commission should be zero.
- Bid-ask spread
- For short sales:
  - Stock borrowing fee
  - Reduced interest on proceeds (short interest rebate)
  - Cannot use proceeds to buy stocks
- Margin loan rate

## Long-short portfolios

- Fed Reg T caps total absolute positions at 200%
- Can go 100% long and 100% short but then no market exposure
- To go more than 100% long, have to use margin loan (or stock index futures).

## 150/50 example

- 150% long and 50% short.  Return is
$$ r_L + 0.5 \times (r_L - r_S + \text{sir} - \text{sbc}  - \text{mlr})$$
  - sir = short-interest rebate
  - sbc = stock borrowing cost
  - mlr = margin loan rate

## Portfolio construction

- Many ways to form a portfolio from return predictions
  - How many stocks to hold?
  - How much shorting?
  - Over-weight higher ranked stocks?
  - Diversify across industries?  Or estimate and minimize risks?
  - Minimize bid-ask spread and stock borrowing costs?
