# Simple Valuation Model {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

## Growing perpetuity

- Cash flows $C_1 = c$, $C_2 = (1+g)c$, $C_3 = (1+g)^2c$ and so on forever.
- Discount rate $r>g$
- PV is

. . .

$$ c\left[\frac{1}{1+r} + \frac{1+g}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{(1+g)^2}{(1+r)^3} + \cdots\right] = \frac{c}{r-g}$$

## Gordon growth model

- We want to value cash flows to shareholders
- $r=$ required return on equity
- Payouts to shareholders = dividends + repurchases - net issues
- Assume earnings, payouts, and book equity all grow at rate $g<r$.
- Define ROE to be earnings divided by lagged (beginning of year) equity.
- Set $k =$ payout ratio $=$ payouts / earnings.


##

- Equity grows by earnings minus payouts = $(1-k) \times$ earnings.
- Earnings $=$ ROE $\times$ lagged equity.
- $g=$ % change in equity $=$ growth in equity / lagged equity

. . .

$$=\frac{(1-k) \times \text{ROE} \times \text{lagged equity}}{\text{lagged equity}}$$

. . .

$$= (1-k) \times \text{ROE}$$

##

- Value of stock is next year's payout / $(r-g)$.
- Next year's payout is $k$ $\times$ next year's earnings.
- Next year's earnings $=$ ROE $\times$ current book equity.
- Theoretical price-to-book $=$ market-to-book

. . .

$$=\left.\frac{k \times \text{ROE} \times \text{book equity}}{r-(1-k)\times \text{ROE}}\right/ \text{book equity}$$

. . .

$$=\frac{k \times \text{ROE}}{r-(1-k)\times \text{ROE}}$$


# Dupont Analysis {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

## 

$$\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Sales}} \times \frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Lagged Assets}} $$
$$\times \frac{\text{Lagged Assets}}{\text{Lagged Equity}}$$

. . .

<br>

$$= \text{Profit Margin} \times \text{Asset Turnover}$$
$$ \times \text{Leverage}$$

##  Sell side and buy side

- Sell-side analysts work for brokerage firms and provide research to brokerage clients.  
  - They are a cost center and research is provided free to generate business (= commissions or advising fees).
- Buy-side analysts work for investment funds who use the research to pick stocks.

## Technical versus fundamental

- Fundamental analysts forecast important ratios and growth rates to produce earnings forecasts and price targets as in Gordon/Dupont.
- Technical analysts use past prices to generate recommendations.

## Technical analysis examples

  - Support and resistance levels. 
    - Previous minimum (support) and maximum (resistance) stock prices are regarded as difficult to breach.  
    - But if breached, the trend is expected to continue.
  - Moving averages: buy when price rises above moving average and sell when it falls below.
  - Chart patterns (head and shoulders, ...)

# Quantitative Investing {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

##

- Quantitative investing means using quantifiable signals to pick stocks and/or to time the market.
- Signals can include ratios and growth rates used by fundamental analysts and price signals used by technical analysts.
- Signals can also include 
  - insider trades, short interest, ...
  - sentiment analysis of social media, traditional media, and company announcements
  - satellite and drone image data, and ...


# Efficient Markets Hypothesis {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

##

- All relevant information is already impounded into prices.
  - Fundamental analysis is futile.
  - Technical analysis is futile.
- Higher expected returns come only with higher risks: arket risk (beta) and/or other types of risks (oil price, ...)

## Counter-argument

- Not all investors are smart
- Smart investors may not scoop up all opportunities
  - Limited capital 
  - Costs of trading
  - For example, an investor who shorts risks running out of capital from margin calls before being eventually right.
- More likely to be opportunities among smaller stocks, which are difficult for large investors to trade.

# Smart beta (factor) investing {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

##

- Groups of stocks with certain characteristics seem to have higher expected returns.
- These stocks also usually tend to move together.
- Maybe they are exposed to some risk that some investors regard as undesirable.
- Maybe you want to take on that risk to get the return.

## 
  
  - The return of the group of stocks is called a factor.
  - Investing in the factor means you will be correlated with the factor.
    - So, if we regress your return on the factor, you will have a positive slope coefficient (beta).
    - Hence the name "smart beta." 
  - Example: Fama-French factors: Small Minus Big, High book-to-market Minus Low book-to-market, Conservative Minus Agressive, Robust Minus Weak.

## Some data <a href=http://bbcx-investments.com/risk/geometric"><img src="images/Rice_Owl.jpg"  style="width:.65in;" align="right"></a>

- Sort into quintiles each month.
- Value weighted return of each group
- Re-sort at the beginning of the next period and continue.

## Quantitative investing agenda

- Find factors worth investing in.
- Decide how to optimally combine them.
- Using ML, we can in principle throw in lots of characteristics and let the machine decide which are useful, but preprocessing is usually useful.
- Need to backtest, which is a variation of the usual ML train-and-test.
